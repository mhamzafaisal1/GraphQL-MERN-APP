# GRAPH QL PRACTICE PROJECT

Graph Ql is a query language for API's. It is an alternative to a REST API, with some added benefits like being able to request exactly the data that is required. This avoids the problem of over-fetching and under-fetching data.

It is sort of a mixture of a REST API and the SQL queries. 

The client sends a query to the server and there is only one end-point here rather than designing multiple routes / endpoints in a REST API. 

The response includes ONLY the data that is asked for.

To add or update or delete Mutation is done. It is similar to doing queries.

GraphIQL is a tool that allows us to make queries to the backend without having a frontend.

GraphQL servers have a "schema" that specifies all of the fields as well as their "types". The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are object types.

# Stack being used in this project is 

Front-end : Apollo + React.Js + Bootstrap 
Back-end : GraphQL + Node.Js + Express-GraphQL + Mongoose + MongoDB Atlas

Apollo is used to Query the GraphQl API that is connected to the graphQL in the server that will be set up.
